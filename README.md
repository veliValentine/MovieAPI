# Movie REST API

This is the 5th and last task for the Experis academy Java Backend course.  
For the first time, we're working in groups (3 people) which means that this project is more complex and demanding than the previous tasks.

The project in short: Create an API with database containing franchises, movies and characters which all has the basic ***CRUD*** (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functions.  
It should also be possible to get ***all movies in a franchise***, ***all characters in a movie*** and ***all characters in a franchise***.

The application then had to be published. This is done via heroku.com as they offer smooth, easy and free deployment. You can find out application at: [Task5-movieapi](http://task5-movieapi.herokuapp.com)

Documentation has been made by the help of Swagger and can be found at: [Documentation](http://task5-movieapi.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui/#/)
